## Algorithms and Data Structures
  Projects completed during procedural programming courses at university. All the comments in the code and the output produced by them are in Polish though.

#### **Binary Search Tree**  
  
  This program reads a text file and uses a binary tree to create a word index. It outputs the number of occurrences of each word and the line numbers where they appear. This information is then saved to another text file.

#### **Printf**
  
  Reimplementation of printf function using putchar.

#### **Priority Queue**
  
  An implementation of a priority queue.

#### **Shortest Path**
  
  Searching for the shortest path through the matrix.

#### **Singly Linked List**  
  
  An implementation of a singly linked list.

#### **Sorting Algorithms Comparison**
  
  Comparing the time it takes different popular sorting algorithms to sort a table.

#### **Stack Calculator**  
  
  A simple calculator that uses stack to execute mathematical operations in the right order.

#### **Systems of Equations Solver**
  
  Solves linear systems of equations using matrix inversion.
